## Tubular Guitar Twisty Turner
#### TEAM TEAM GO NAME TEAM

Our submission for UGA Hacks X is an automatic tuner. The user connects to a rapsberry pi (acting like a router) and uses the website to listen to their guitar. from there, the raspberry pi uses a forward fourier transmission (originally from https://github.com/cwilso/PitchDetect/tree/main) and extends it to implement live tracking. Furthermore, the Tubular Guitar Twisty Turner then tunes the guitar.
